# KeyloggerDetector

## Overview
This Python script is designed to detect potential keyloggers running on a macOS system. Keyloggers are malicious programs that capture keystrokes, potentially compromising user privacy and security. This script aims to identify suspicious processes and programs that may indicate the presence of a keylogger.

## Features
- **Process Monitoring:** The script monitors running processes on the system and flags any processes with names containing common keywords associated with keyloggers.
- **Startup Program Analysis:** It checks for suspicious programs configured to run at system startup by inspecting the user's LaunchAgents folder.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Placeholder for implementing network traffic analysis logic to detect keyloggers transmitting data over the network.
- **Signature Scanning:** Placeholder for implementing signature scanning logic to identify known keylogger patterns.
- **Behavior Analysis:** Placeholder for implementing behavior analysis logic to detect unusual activities associated with keyloggers.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your macOS system.
2. Download the `keylogger_detection.py` script to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script by executing the following command:
5. The script will analyze running processes and startup programs, displaying any suspicious findings.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- psutil library (can be installed via pip: `pip install psutil`)

## Notes
- This script is tailored specifically for macOS systems and may not work on other operating systems without modification.
- Additional functionality such as network traffic analysis, signature scanning, and behavior analysis can be implemented based on specific requirements and expertise.
- It's important to use this script responsibly and with proper authorization, respecting user privacy and legal boundaries.
